Fluid dynamics of Earth Atmosphere and Climate - Midterm exam - March 2015 
Please   write   your   name   on   each   page.
1.      Consider   an   air   parcel   at   T = 300K   and   ρ =   1kg   m-3   .
a.   Determine   the   air   pressure   using   the   ideal   gas   law.
b.   If the parcel contains   10 gram of water vapor per kilo of dry air,   determine   the   partial   pressure   of water   vapor.c.       How    much   water   vapor   should   be      added   to   this      air   parcel   to   bring   it   to   saturation,   knowing   that   the   saturation   vapor   pressure   at   300K   is   es      =   3500Pa.
(The   ideal   gas   constant   for   dry   air   is   Rd      =   287JK-1kg-1   .         The   ideal   gas   constant   for water vapor   is   Rv    =   460JK-1kg-1.)
Please   clearly   write   down   the   formulas   you   are   using   for   the   computation.   You   need   only   to   carry   the   computation   to   the   ﬁrst   two   digits.
2.   Below is a reproduction   of the   ﬁgure   2.7   from   the   textbook   showing   the   energy fluxes in the simple   greenhouse   model.

a.   Briefly   deﬁne each terms   (namely   Ta   ,   Ts   ,   S   ,   A,   S0       and   α)   shown   in the   ﬁgure.
b.   What is the physical   law   that   relates   the   radiation flux   A   and   S   to   the   temperature of the atmosphere and surface?c.   Write the energy budget for the   Earth   surface,   for the   atmospheric   layer   and for the whole planet (surface and atmosphere combined) as described by   the ﬁgure.
d.    Determine   the   temperature   of   the   surface   as   function   of   the   incoming   solar radiation S0      and the   albedo   α   .
3.a.   Explain   the   concept代 写Fluid dynamics of Earth Atmosphere and Climate - Midterm examC/C++

b.    Write   the   expression   for   the   buoyancy   of   an   air   parcel   as   function   of   its   density卩p and   that   of the   environment卩e.c.       By   taking    advantage   of   the   ideal   gas   law,      express   the   buoyancy   of   an   air   parcel   as   function   of   its   temperature.      (You   can   assume   that   the   parcel   pressure   is   the   same   as   that   of the   environment.)d.    What   is   the   acceleration   in   a   hot   air   ballon   ﬁlled   with   warm   air   at   T   =   360K while   the   outside   air   is   at   T = 300?    If the   mass   of   air   in   the   ballon   is   1000kg,   how   much   additional   weight   can   it   carry   in   the   basket?
4.    For   an   adiabatic   parcel,   the   ﬁrst   law   of   thermodynamics   can   be   written   as
where   Cp      =   1000 JK-1kg-1    is   the   heat   capacity   of dry   air   at   constant   pres-   sure,   T   is   the   parcel   temperature,   g   =   10ms-2    is   the   gravitational   accelera-   tion,   and   Z   is   its   altitude.
a.   From   this   equation,   derive   the   adiabatic   lapse   rate.b.      Provide   a   physical   explanation   as   to   why   the   temperature   decreases   as   an   air parcel rises   (in other words,   explain   the   concept   of   the   adiabatic   lapse   rate   to   one   of your   friend   who   has   not   taken   the   course.)
c.   Inside   a   cloud,   equation   (1)   does   not   hold   any   more.   Discuss   how   conden-   sation   afects   the   adiabatic   ascent?
d.    How   would   you   modify   equation   (1)   to   account   fro   the   efect   of   conden-   sation?
